This project was supported by the Denison Research Scholarship.

I analysed the diffusion dynamics of neural activity using a single
subject from the WU-Minn Human Connectome Project. The subject
was a young adult (age 22-35) and went four 15-minute scans
(1 frame per 0.72 s) in a resting state (relaxed fixation on
a bright cross-hair in a darkened room).

The above figure shows the trajectories of active regions on a 2D map of the subject's left cerebral cortex hemisphere.
This was measured at a single time point, and the warmer regions indicate increased activity.

The diffusion analysis was performed using mean square displacements of the 874 active trajectories (as shown above). I also computed the diffusion exponent of six regions of interest from the log-log representation of the mean square displacements.
The regions of interest were chosen based on task-positive regions (Frontal Eye Field, Intraparietal Sulcus, Middle Temporal region) and 
task-negative regions (Medial Prefrontal Cortex, Posterior Cingulate Cortex, Lateral Parietal Cortex).
T-tests were then performed to determine any statistically significant differences 
between the Î± values of a region of interest and the whole cortex.

A superdiffusive process of the propagation of active regions
was found, with the task-negative Posterior
Cingulate Cortex displaying faster diffusion processes relative to the active regions in the cerebral cortex.
Conversely, the task-positive Frontal Eye Field displayed slower diffusive processes.
This was because the default mode network becomes more
active during the resting-state that the subject was in, and
the task-positive regions are anti-correlated.

Interestingly, the remaining regions of interest had no statistically
significant differences in the diffusion exponent compared to
the cortex. This could be attributed to the low sample size
of trajectories within the regions of interest, which may not
adequately represent their neural dynamics.
