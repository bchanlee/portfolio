This project was supported by the Denison Research Scholarship.

I analysed the diffusion dynamics of neural activity using a single
subject from the WU-Minn Human Connectome Project.

The above figure shows the trajectories of active regions on a 2D map of the subject's left cerebral cortex hemisphere.
This was measured at a single time point, and the warmer regions indicate increased activity.

The diffusion analysis was performed using mean square displacements of the 874 active trajectories (as shown above). I also computed the α values of a region of interest (e.g. posterior cingulate cortex)
from the log-log representation of the mean square displacement function. T-tests were then performed to determine any statistically significant differences 
between the α values of a region of interest and the whole cortex.

A superdiffusive process of the propagation of active regions
was found, with an influential task-negative region (Posterior
Cingulate Cortex) displaying faster diffusion processes relative to the active regions in the cerebral cortex.
Conversely, the task-positive region (Fontral Eye Field) displayed slower diffusive processes.
This was because the default mode network becomes more
active during the resting-state that the subject was in, and
the task-positive regions are anti-correlated.
